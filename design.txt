## Group

A group G is an object with the following members:

- G.size is the number of elements in the group.
- G.identity is the identity element.
- G.inv(x) returns the inverse of x, where x is 0,1,...,G.size-1.
- G.mul(x,y) returns xy where x,y are in 0,1,...,G.size-1.

These operations should all be deterministic. These are required to satisfy the usual group axioms:

- G.mul(x, G.inv(x)) == G.identity
- G.mul(G.inv(x),x) == G.identity
- G.mul(x, G.identity) == x
- G.mul(G.identity,x) == x
- G.mul(x, G.mul(y,z)) == G.mul(G.mul(x,y), z)

## Group presentation

A group presentation P is an object with the following members:

- P.group is the underlying group.
- P.gens is a list of group elements.
- P.get_presentation(x) returns a list of indices into P.gens that indicate how to decompose the
  group element x.
- (optional) P.gen_names is a list of length len(P.gens) with the names of the generators. This makes it a named presentation.
  
These operations should be deterministic and satisfy the following axioms:

- P.group is a group.
- P.gens has no duplicates.
- functools.reduce(P.group.mul, [P.gens[idx] for idx in P.get_presentation(x)]) == x
